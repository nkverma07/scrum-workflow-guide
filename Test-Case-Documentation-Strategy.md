# Test Case Documentation Strategy

## Purpose

This page defines the standardized approach for documenting test cases, ensuring clarity, consistency, and ease of collaboration for both trainees and experienced developers.

## Approach

- **Unit & Integration Tests**:  
  - No Test Case IDs in code.
  - Use detailed Python docstrings to document title, purpose, mocking, and assertion strategies.
  - All mocks use generic, non-sensitive data.
  - Assertion is strict: always check for exact returned data and type.

- **UI Tests**:  
  - Use Jira/Zephyr standard templates with Test Case IDs for traceability.
  - Documented as per the template provided.

- **Documentation Location**:  
  - Test case documentation should be maintained in the repo and mirrored in the Wiki for easy access and onboarding.

- **Clarity & Brevity**:  
  - Use clear, concise language. Avoid ambiguous statements.

- **Review & Update**:  
  - Regularly review and update test cases to maintain relevance as features evolve.

## For New Contributors & Trainees

- Always start from these templates.
- When unsure, refer to the examples and best practices.
- Ask for peer review on your first few test cases to ensure youâ€™re following the standards.
